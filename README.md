# Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard
# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard using Power BI

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes and analyzes road accident data across various Indian states. The dashboard helps in identifying accident trends, high-risk regions, and potential factors contributing to accidents.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard includes:
- **KPI Cards**: Total Accidents, Registered Vehicles, Fatalities
- **Line Chart**: Year-wise trend of accidents and fatalities
- **Bar Chart**: State-wise accident distribution
- **Pie Chart**: Percentage of accidents per state
- **Map Visual**: Geographical distribution of accidents
- **Scatter Plot**: Correlation between registered vehicles and accidents
- **Gauge Chart**: Progress toward accident thresholds
- **Slicers**: Year and State filters for dynamic analysis

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Road accidents are a major concern due to the increasing number of fatalities and injuries. Traditional data reporting methods lack interactivity and clarity, making it difficult for policymakers and the public to extract actionable insights.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

To address this, an interactive dashboard is created using Power BI to:
- Visualize trends over the years
- Identify accident hotspots
- Correlate registered vehicle data with accidents
- Enable informed decision-making using data analytics

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Power BI Desktop** – Data visualization
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **GitHub** – Version control and code sharing

## 📁 Dataset

- File: `Cleaned_VehicleRoadAccident.csv`
- Source: [Insert source link if available]
- Contains: State-wise accident data, number of fatalities, registered vehicles, and accident locations across multiple years

## ⚙️ Features

- Interactive filtering and drill-down capabilities
- Clear visual representation of complex datasets
- Custom visuals (e.g., Gauge Chart, Map)
- Clean, modern design with road safety themes

## 📈 Results & Insights

- Urban states show higher accident counts
- Accidents increase with vehicle registration but not always fatalities
- Accident-prone states identified for targeted interventions

## ⚠️ Limitations

- State-level data only (no city/district breakdown)
- No cause-level data (e.g., rash driving, weather conditions)
- Historical dataset; no real-time updates

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Integration with real-time data sources (IoT sensors, traffic APIs)
- More granular analysis at the district or city level
- Predictive analytics for accident prevention
- Mobile-responsive dashboard versions
